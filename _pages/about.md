Greetings! I am Chen Xi, a PhD candidate at the School of [Materials Science and Engineering(MSE)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mse), [Nanyang Technological University(NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg)(Singapore), supervised by [Prof. Li Shuzhou](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00773). I was awared a M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering at the [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://ee.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020 advised by [Prof. Deng Junbo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/zh/web/dengjb/home). Prior to my Master, I obtained my B.Eng. (2017) in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Chongqing University](http://www.cee.cqu.edu.cn/).

I am deeply passionate about the diverse facets of theoretical and computational materials science. My current research focuses on simulating charge transport in organic semiconductors for flexible electronics, leveraging a range of techniques including density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), and machine learning. Additionally, my collaborative projects extend to energy storage, exploring areas such as electrolytes and polymer capacitors to provide microscale insights into critical challenges in the field. Please take a look at the Projects and Publications pages to learn more about my research and publications!
